Slipface deposition rate calculation utility

This utility calculates slipface deposition rates within dune fields. Slipface deposition rates can be easily compared against vegetation deposition tolerance to understand the influences of geomorphology on stabilization and reactivation processes. Further details about the software parameters and method are detailed in an upcoming publication. An additional readme file can be downloaded from my website with further details about ArcGIS integration: tbarchyn.blogspot.ca. Please drop me a line if you find this tool useful or have any problems: tbarchyn [at] gmail.com. I look forward to hearing from you!
